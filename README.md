# :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Repo Overview

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used in the book chapter on using Jupyter for data science in metabolomics. It is designed to support reproducible learning through hands-on exploration, visualization, and analysis of metabolomics data. 

The included notebooks are intended to be run on **Google Colab** for easy access and setup:

- ***Notebook 00 (Python)***: Jupyter notebook basics (5 minute tutorial) or an in-depth tutorial.
  
- ***Notebook 01 (Python)***: Understanding core LC-MS concepts and exploring unprocessed LC-MS metabolomics data using common metabolomics/data science tools such as pandas, seaborn, pymzML, and asari (e.g. plotting spectrum, mass tracks, chromatograms)

- ***Notebook 02 (R & Python)***: Analyzing processed metabolomics data (i.e. feature table) using stats, ggplot2, and tidyr (e.g. PCAs, data normalization, and univariate analysis)

Jupyter supports multiple programming languages; the book chapter focuses on Python and R, the two most widely used in metabolomics data science.

## :rocket: Getting Started

### 1. Open Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab

Navigate to the /notebooks folder in this repository. In each notebook, you will see a blue "Open in Colab" button. Click on it to directly launch the notebook in Google Colab.

### 2. Download Jupyter notebooks and upload to Google Colab

Download the notebooks from the /notebook folder of this GitHub repository. Go to the [Google Colab homepage](https://colab.research.google.com/) and 
a pop-up should appear that says "Open notebook". In the left-side options, select upload. Drag-and-drop the downloaded notebook and voila! You are ready to explore the notebook in Colab.
