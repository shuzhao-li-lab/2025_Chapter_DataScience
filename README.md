# :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Repo Overview

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used in the book chapter on using Jupyter for data science in metabolomics. It is designed to support reproducible learning through hands-on exploration, visualization, and analysis of metabolomics data. 

The included notebooks are intended to be run on **Google Colab** for easy access and setup:

- ***Notebook 00a (Python)***: Jupyter notebook in five minutes.

- ***Notebook 00b (Python)***: An in-depth tutorial of Jupyter notebook and Google Colab.
  
- ***Notebook 01 (Python)***: Exploring LC-MS metabolomics data, plotting spectrum, mass tracks and extracted chromatograms. This uses common data science tools such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn; metabolomics tools like pymzML and asari. 

- ***Notebook 02 Python***: Common examples of metabolomics data analysis in Python (data wrangling, Student t-tests, FDR-correction, fold-change, and volcano plots).

- ***Notebook 02 R***: Common examples of metabolomics data analysis in R.

Jupyter supports multiple programming languages; the book chapter focuses on Python and R, the two most widely used in metabolomics data science.

## :rocket: Getting Started

There are multiple options to use these notebooks. 

### Option 1. Open Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab.

Navigate to the /notebooks folder in this repository. In each notebook, you will see a blue "Open in Colab" button. Click on it to directly launch the notebook in Google Colab.

### Option 2. Download Jupyter notebooks and upload to Google Colab.

Download the notebooks from the /notebook folder of this GitHub repository. Go to the [Google Colab homepage](https://colab.research.google.com/) and 
a pop-up should appear that says "Open notebook". In the left-side options, select upload. Drag-and-drop the downloaded notebook and voila! You are ready to explore the notebook in Colab.

### Option 3. Download Jupyter notebooks and run locally.

We recommend to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Then install Python and Jupyter notebook within VS Code. 
One can also use standalone [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install), or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Within Anaconda Navigator, you can find the notebook.
